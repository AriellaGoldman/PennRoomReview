		<p>Penn Room Review is a website where Penn students can submit and read reviews about on campus rooms. 
		
		<p>We decided there was a need for this website during the recent housing selection (Jan '14). Sam's current room in the high rises seems to lack a closet door and Housing maintenance doesn't seem to care. She'd obviously prefer a closet door. Both Krupka and Ariella found out that some triples in Rodin have baths and some only have showers. This was apparently a problem for each of their roommates. 
		
		<p>Therefore, we decided to create one unified location where housing information can be asessed. Not everyone has friendly RA/GAs y'know.
